## Workflows

#### Fibonacci Numbers
Generates fibonacci numbers (useful for effort estimation)

#### Toggle Hidden Folders
Toggles hidden files and bounces Finder to ensure the new setting takes effect

#### Clean Desktop (forthcoming)
Moves all the files on your desktop to a folder in your home directory and 
can move them back when you wish.

#### Restart Dock (forthcoming)
Restarts the Dock. I find that Dock crashes fairly frequently (or at least doesn't let me 
get to Mission Control), so this is a handy one for me.
